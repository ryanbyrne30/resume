            As a cyber architect I have gotten the opportunity to work with many
            teams to develop secure and reliable infrastructure to enable all
            development teams to work efficiently. This includes collaborating
            with system, security, network and software engineers, building and
            integrating custom and scalable security tools across multiple
            domains, and automating report generation to present to leadership.
